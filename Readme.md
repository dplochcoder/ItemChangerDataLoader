ICDL is a mod for launching saves modified by ItemChanger through the menu. In particular, it can be used to start plandos, or it can be used to replay randomizers.

With the "Backup New Rando Saves" settings on (active by default), ICDL creates a backup whenever a randomizer save is created from the main menu. Backups can be found in the "Past Randos" subdirectory of the ICDL mod directory, and are given automatically generated names of the form "{Seed} - {timestamp}". Backups can be accessed from the "Past Randos" mode menu.

ICDL also supports putting packs in the "Plandos" subdirectory of the ICDL mod directory. A pack must have a "pack.json" and a "ic.json" file (refer to randomizer backups for what these should contain). It may also have a "ctx.json" file if it will make use of randomizer's tracker log and helper log features. Packs work identically to randomizer backups, and can be accessed from the "Plando Plando" mode menu.

Note: the respective mode menus will only appear when they are nonempty.
